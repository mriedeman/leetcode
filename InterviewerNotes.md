# Interviewer Notes

I don't usually ask all of these, and I usually tailor them somewhat, but this is the template that I usually take as a baseline and then add or remove questions as seems appropriate.
Openers:
--------
Structure:
 some get-to-know-you icebreaker stuff
walk us through your code sample (if there was one)
some more-technical questions
some less-technical questions
and finally some time for you to ask us any questions you have.
So first off - what's your story?  How have you come to be where you are in your career?
Do you have any questions before we begin, especially about the interview process?
More technical questions:
-------------------------
What are the SOLID principles?  Which is your favorite one? (No right answer to the "favorite one", mostly a jumping-off point for further conversation)
What's your experience with - and take on - ORMs? (I'm looking here to distinguish between "I've worked on a project that used EF" vs "I have implemented a DAL using EF")
You roll onto a project and nobody is working, and won't be for two weeks.  What would you do with your time to familiarize yourself with the codebase?
What's your experience with automated testing?
What CI/CD tools are you used to using? (Similar to the ORM question, looking for "have used at all" is very different than "have configured" or "have been responsible for setup of")
Are you familiar with containerization?
What are important considerations to make sure that code is testable?
Can you describe an example of a time you had to evaluate the tradeoffs between different approaches?
Typically add a few language-specific questions - EG in .NET I might ask about familiarity with LINQ, for JS I'll ask what frameworks they've played with, etc.
If there was no code sample provided, and if the candidate seems open to it, and if there is time - a code challenge I sometimes use is "Given the lyrics to a song as a string, write a class or method that outputs each distinct word in the lyrics and a count of how many times that word appears".
Things I'm looking for: there are some common gotchas (like punctuation, capitalization, and linebreaks); do they note that ahead of time, or get a semi-working implementation and then fix those defects?
If we do a live-coding exercise like this, I typically tell them that they should feel free to Google things as they need - as long as they do so on the screen that they're sharing.  I want to make them comfortable, and to acknowledge that "looking things up" is, in itself, a useful career skill - I'm not dinging them for not remembering a method name, I'm interested to see what their search methodology for that looks like.
Less technical:
---------------
What experience with agile principles do you have?
What are you looking for in a team?
What's your understanding of consulting?  Is that an environment that appeals to you?  Do you have any questions about it?
Have you done much work eliciting requirements?
What are your preferences around team size?
Finally, I ask if they have any questions for us.  I try to leave at least fifteen minutes for this part.  This often also opens up into "things that are cool about Excella".
